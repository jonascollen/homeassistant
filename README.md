# Home Assistant

My attempt at building a smarthome with Home Assistant, work in progress.. :) 
Running Hass.io on a NUCi5 VM-box together with:

* SSH & OpenVPN
* Personal webserver (apache2) & Ombi
* Plex & Tautulli
* Portainer, Influxdb, Grafana, Organizr, Telegraf & Unifi Controller  

And some more stuff not integrated with HA..
